//Here I begin assignment 4B

// I created a JSON file out of my list from assignment 3 and named it bookList.json
//Hopefully you'll see it here soon.

//Now that jQuery has been loaded, I will create a $(document).ready function

//Now I will create a function within document ready, and call it bookSort
